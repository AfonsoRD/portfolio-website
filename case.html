                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>myFlix is a single page application (SPA), built using React as a framework, that provides users with
                    tons of fun information about movies, genres and directors using a REST API and a database called
                    "movies-api". In this APP, users can create their own profile, save their favorite movies and delete
                    their account.</p>

                <p>Tech-stack: <span>MERN</span></p>
                <br>
                <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                <p>I have built myFlix during my CareerFoundry’s Full-Stack Web Development course to master my skills
                    in JavaScript. The project was divided in 2 parts: Server-side and Client-side.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The objective was to learn and master the MERN tech stack and create a flawless bug-free and
                    responsive APP to include in my portfolio.</p>

        <div class="server-side">
            <div class="server-content">
                <h3>Server-Side</h3>
                <p>I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database
                    (MongoDB). The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data
                    from and store data in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides movie information in
                    JSON format.</p>
                <p>This project is the REST API built using Node.js for the server-side of the application that
                    interacts with a non-relational database that in this case was MongoDP. The database can store
                    movies and users using CRUD methods in JSON format.
                    To access the data base, can be done using the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE).</p>
                <br />

                </p>

                <br />
                <p>To secure the application, I used user authentication and encryption of user data, using JWT
                    authentication.
                </p>
                <p>The database was tested using Postman.</p>

                <h3>Client-Side</h3>
                <p>The next step was creating a beautiful responsive UI to connect my database with the client-side, and
                    I have use React, React-Redux and Bootstrap. The APP it’s a SPA (single page application) that
                    contain 5 different views for the user.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>This was both my favorite and most challenging project. I have enjoyed building the API and working with
                database structures. I also quickly became familiar with using the terminal. Developing the client-side,
                it took me a while to understand how React and Redux work and how to achieve the desired results. But
                with the help of my great tutor and after a pair-programming session with an experienced developer, I
                could conquer that mountain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="duration">
            <h2>Duration</h2>
            <p>The development of the client-side took me twice as long as it normally took to complete a CareerFoundry
                achievement. It was because I needed time to wrap my head around how React (and React Redux) work.</p>
